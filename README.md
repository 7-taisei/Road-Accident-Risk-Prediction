# Predicting Road Accident Risk in the UK
A machine learning project to predict the severity of road accidents based on the Kaggle competition dataset.
## Overview
This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents (classified as 'Fatal', 'Serious', or 'Slight') in the UK using various environmental and situational factors. The model is developed based on the data from the ["Predicting Road Accident Risk"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e10/overview) Kaggle competition.

## Dataset
The dataset for this competitionã€€was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Simulated Roads Accident dataset.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python3
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LightGBM, Optuna
* **Environment:** Google Colaboratory
